Welcome!

Feel free to use LapGrid to any your project. 
This project does not have any license, so you can safely copy any code from here.

In the project you will find two main files:
1. LapGridLayout.swift - here you can find the layout itself.
2. ContentView.swift - here you can find few examples of using the layout. Just compile the project and check how it works.
